## WinMasto

(MODIFIED TO WORK WITH PLEROMA)
[Original Project Here](https://github.com/drasticactions/WinMasto)

WinMasto is a UWP client for Mastodon, a GNU social-compatible federated social network. You can learn more about Mastodon [here](https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon). The goal of this project is to create a simple, elegant, Mastodon client that doesn't try to stuff as many power user features in as possible.

## Features

* Background Task support, including Live Tiles and Toasts
* Most major Mastodon functions should be working, including:
  * Posting, including setting visibility and content warnings and attaching images
  * Boosting and favoriting posts
  * Following and unfollowing
  * Notifications
  * Home, Local, and Federated timelines
  * Dark and light themes


## Contributions

Open a GitHub issue for bugs, feature requests, etc. I work on this app in my spare time, so I may not be able to fix or add new features, but if anyone else wants to help out, you can send a pull request, and I'll be happy to look at it.

## Building

To build WinMasto, you'll need:

- Windows 10 (1703, AKA Redstone 2, AKA Creators Update)
- Visual Studio 2017

Pull down the Mastonet submodule, open the WinMasto solution, and you should be able just to build it.
